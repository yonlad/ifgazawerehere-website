                    <em>"If Gaza Were Here"</em> is a powerful multimedia art project that reimagines the devastating impact of the Gaza conflict by transposing its reality onto recognizable Western landmarks and cultural institutions.

                    Through aerial imagery and video, this project asks viewers to confront a challenging question: What if the destruction happening in Gaza occurred in places we know and cherish? By overlaying the scale and scope of devastation onto sites like the Louvre, Harvard University, and the Brandenburg Gate, the project creates a visceral connection that transcends geographical and cultural distances.

                    This work serves as both a memorial and a mirror, inviting reflection on how we perceive suffering based on proximity and familiarity. It challenges us to recognize the universal value of human life, cultural heritage, and the spaces we call home—regardless of where they are located on a map.

                    The gallery presents a series of contemplative visual comparisons, each frame representing a sacred space—whether it be a center of learning, art, worship, or commerce—reimagined as ground zero. These are not just buildings or landmarks; they are symbols of human achievement, community, and memory.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    By bringing Gaza "here," wherever "here" may be, this project aims to foster empathy, spark dialogue, and inspire action toward peace and justice for all people affected by conflict.
